In this Mermaid diagram:
- **Pulse** is shown as the starting point for data/messages.
- **Conduit** is represented as the pathway for transmitting messages.
- **Nexus** is the central processing service.
- **PulseFlow** is depicted as handling and manipulating the messages.

When you include this in a GitHub Markdown file, GitHub will render the Mermaid diagram as a visual graph. Remember to remove the extra backticks (```) in the beginning and end when adding this to your README.

### Use Cases

PulseFlow is a general-purpose messaging system that can be used in a wide variety of applications. It's particularly
useful in scenarios where there's a need for asynchronous communication between different parts of the system.

## Getting Started

This section provides a quick guide on how to get started with PulseFlow Local Messaging.

### Installation

PulseFlow is available as a NuGet package, which can be installed using the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Frank.PulseFlow
```

## Concepts

This section provides an in-depth explanation of the key concepts and components within the system: Nexus, Conduit,
Pulse, and PulseFlow. Understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping how the system operates and interacts with
data.

### Nexus

The **Nexus** is the central hub of our messaging system, analogous to a neural network's core. It serves as the primary
processing service, where all data messages, or 'Pulses', are received, interpreted, and routed to their respective
destinations.

- **Role**: Nexus acts as the orchestrator within the system, managing the flow of messages and ensuring that each one
  is processed according to predefined rules and logic.
- **Functionality**: It handles various tasks like message validation, transformation, and decision-making on how and
  where messages should be directed post-processing.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Designed for high performance and scalability, Nexus can handle a vast volume of
  messages simultaneously, ensuring minimal latency and high throughput in data processing.

### Conduit

The **Conduit** represents the pathway through which messages, or 'Pulses', are transmitted within the system. It's the
messenger that ensures the delivery of data from one point to another.

- **Mechanism**: Conduit facilitates the smooth and efficient transport of messages across different parts of the
  system.
- **Reliability and Integrity**: Ensuring data integrity, Conduit maintains the fidelity of the messages as they
  traverse through various processes.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: It supports asynchronous data flow, allowing for non-blocking and concurrent message
  transmissions, which is key for a responsive and efficient system.

### Pulse

**Pulse** is the term used to describe the individual units of data or messages that flow through the system.

- **Data Encapsulation**: Each Pulse is a packet of information, encapsulating the necessary data in a well-defined
  format.
- **Types and Variability**: Pulses can vary in type and structure, ranging from simple text messages to complex data
  structures, each tailored to carry specific information relevant to its intended process.
- **Lifecycle**: The lifecycle of a Pulse includes its creation, transmission through the Conduit, processing in the
  Nexus, and final delivery or action as dictated by the system's logic.

### PulseFlow

**PulseFlow** is the sophisticated mechanism responsible for handling and manipulating the Pulses as they move through
the system.

- **Message Handling**: It's specifically designed to process each Pulse, applying necessary transformations, routing,
  and any other required operations.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: PulseFlow is adept at handling various types of Pulses, capable of adapting its
  processing logic based on the nature and requirements of each message.
- **Integration Point**: Acting as a key integration point within the system, it ensures that Pulses are managed
  efficiently and effectively, readying them for their next phase in the data journey.
